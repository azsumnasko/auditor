To document all dashboard features and user instructions, we need to create a  
README file that outlines the functionality and usage of the dashboard.        
Additionally, we should suggest improvements for future enhancements.          

Let's start by creating a new README file for the dashboard.                   

dashboard_readme.md

2. **User Authentication**                                                     
                                                                               
   - Add user authentication to restrict access to the dashboard based on roles
and permissions.                                                               
                                                                               
                                                                               
                                                                               
3. **Customizable Dashboards**                                                 
                                                                               
   - Allow users to customize their dashboards by selecting specific metrics   
and charts.
